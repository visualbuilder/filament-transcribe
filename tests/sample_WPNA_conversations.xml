        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            Good morning! I'm Mike, your ergonomic assessor. It’s lovely to meet you on this sunny morning. How are you feeling today? I hope the traffic wasn’t too hectic coming in.
        </voice>
        <break time="800ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Good morning, Mike! Actually, I took the bus, so it wasn’t bad at all. I’m feeling okay, just eager to sort out my workspace to ease some of the discomfort.
        </voice>
        <break time="800ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            I’m glad to hear the commute was smooth. Making your workspace comfortable is exactly what I’m here for. Could I just confirm your full name and date of birth for our records before we get started?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Sure, it’s Jane Doe, born on the 15th of June, 1985.
        </voice>
        <break time="800ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            Thank you, Jane. Now, could you start by describing any discomfort or strain you experience while working?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            I spend about 8 hours a day at my desk, and I’ve been having lower back pain and wrist discomfort lately.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            Understood. Let’s start with your chair. Do you know if it has <emphasis level="moderate">lumbar support</emphasis>?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            I believe so, but I don’t think it’s adjustable.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            That might be an issue. Your lower back needs support at the <emphasis level="moderate">L4-L5 region</emphasis> to maintain a neutral spine.
            We may need to replace it with an <emphasis level="moderate">adjustable ergonomic chair</emphasis>.
            Now, what about your keyboard and mouse? Are you using a <emphasis level="moderate">wrist rest</emphasis>?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            No, just a standard keyboard. My wrist feels strained, especially after long typing sessions.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            That could be <emphasis level="moderate">repetitive strain injury, RSI</emphasis>, developing.
            I recommend a <emphasis level="moderate">split ergonomic keyboard</emphasis> and a <emphasis level="moderate">vertical mouse</emphasis> to reduce ulnar deviation.
            Also, let’s check your screen position. It should be at <emphasis level="moderate">eye level to avoid cervical strain</emphasis>.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Oh, my screen is definitely too low—I’m always looking down.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            A <emphasis level="moderate">monitor riser</emphasis> should help. I’ll document these recommendations,
            and we’ll ensure your setup follows <emphasis level="moderate">DSE, Display Screen Equipment, regulations</emphasis>.
            By the way, for our records and to help with follow-up, could you confirm your address and contact details again?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Absolutely, it's 123 Baker Street, London NW1 6XE, and my phone number is 020 7946 0958. Should I include my email as well?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            Yes, please, that would be very helpful.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Sure, it’s jane.doe@example.com. Thanks for making this an easy process, Mike!

            Hi, I understand you use screen magnification software. How’s that working for you?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            It helps, but sometimes I struggle with certain applications that aren’t fully accessible.

        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">

        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Yes, JAWS mainly, but some web-based systems aren’t fully optimized.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            That’s a common issue. We’ll review <emphasis level="moderate">WCAG 2.1 compliance</emphasis> for your software.
            Have you tried <emphasis level="moderate">high-contrast mode</emphasis> or <emphasis level="moderate">Braille display support</emphasis>?

        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            High-contrast mode is useful, but I don’t have a <emphasis level="moderate">refreshable Braille display</emphasis>.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            We can explore funding for that through <emphasis level="moderate">Access to Work grants</emphasis>.
            Also, let’s check your workstation lighting—<emphasis level="moderate">glare reduction</emphasis> can improve readability.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            That would be great. Some areas of the office are too dim for me.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            Noted. We’ll recommend <emphasis level="moderate">adjustable LED task lighting</emphasis> and training for your team on digital accessibility.

            Thanks for meeting with me. I understand remote work presents some challenges for you.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            Yes, I have <emphasis level="moderate">sensory processing difficulties</emphasis>, so too many video calls exhaust me.
            Also, switching tasks disrupts my focus.
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            That makes sense. Have you tried using <emphasis level="moderate">noise-cancelling headphones</emphasis> or a <emphasis level="moderate">blue light filter</emphasis> to manage sensory overload?
        </voice>
        <break time="750ms"/>

        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            A <emphasis level="moderate">warm light filter</emphasis> could help.

        <break time="750ms"/>
        <voice language="en-GB" gender="female">
            That would be great. I prefer structured updates over email or Slack.

        <voice language="en-GB" gender="male">
            Noted. We’ll also recommend a <emphasis level="moderate">task batching approach</emphasis> and

            We can introduce <emphasis level="moderate">anti-fatigue mats</emphasis> and an <emphasis level="moderate">adjustable workbench</emphasis>.
